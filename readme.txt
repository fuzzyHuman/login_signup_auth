Backend Functionality Overview
The backend of this project is built using Node.js and Express.js, with MongoDB as the database. The main focus of the backend is to handle user authentication through JWT (JSON Web Token) and provide secure routes for managing user data.

**1. Database Connection and Configuration
Database: MongoDB is used as the database, and Mongoose is the ODM (Object Data Modeling) library to interact with MongoDB. The connection to the database is established in the db.js file using environment variables for security.

Environment Variables: Key configurations, such as PORT, MONGO_URI, and JWT_SECRET, are stored in a .env file. These are essential for setting up the database connection, starting the server, and managing JWT authentication.

**2. **User Model
User Schema: The User model defines the structure of user data in the database. The schema includes fields like username, email, password, and date. The password is hashed using bcrypt before saving it to the database to ensure security.

Password Hashing: The password is automatically hashed using bcrypt in a pre-save middleware function, ensuring that plain text passwords are never stored in the database.

**3. **Authentication Routes
Signup Route (/api/auth/signup): This route handles user registration. It checks if the email is already registered, hashes the user's password, and then saves the user to the database. Upon successful registration, a JWT token is generated and returned, along with the username.

Login Route (/api/auth/login): This route handles user login. It verifies the user's credentials by comparing the provided password with the stored hashed password. If valid, it generates a JWT token and returns it along with the username.

User Information Route (/api/auth/user): This protected route retrieves the user's information based on the JWT token provided in the request header. It returns the username and other non-sensitive data.

**4. **JWT Authentication
Token Generation: JWT tokens are generated during signup and login, containing the user's ID and username. These tokens are signed with a secret key and have an expiration time of 5 hours.

Token Verification: An authentication middleware (authMiddleware) is used to protect routes. It checks for the token in the request header (x-auth-token), verifies its validity, and attaches the decoded user information to the request object for further processing.

**5. **Middleware
CORS Middleware: CORS is enabled to allow cross-origin requests, particularly from the frontend running on a different domain or port.

JSON Parsing Middleware: Express's built-in JSON parser is used to handle JSON request bodies.

**6. **Error Handling
Error Handling: Basic error handling is implemented in each route to catch and respond to errors such as database issues, invalid tokens, and incorrect credentials.
Frontend Functionality Overview
The frontend is built using React.js. The main focus of the frontend is to provide a user interface for authentication, manage user sessions, and interact with the backend API to perform CRUD operations securely.

**1. **User Interface
Sign In and Sign Up Forms: The frontend provides forms for users to sign in or sign up. These forms include fields for username, email, and password. Basic validation is implemented to ensure that all required fields are filled out and that passwords meet minimum strength requirements.

Error Handling: The forms display clear error messages if the input is invalid or if there is an issue with the authentication process (e.g., incorrect credentials, user already exists).

Responsive Design: The user interface is designed to be responsive, ensuring a smooth experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

**2. **User Authentication and Session Management
JWT Storage: Upon successful authentication (sign in or sign up), the JWT token is stored in localStorage or sessionStorage based on the user's choice to "Remember Me." This allows the application to persist the user's session across browser sessions or until the browser is closed.

Session Validation: On page load, the application checks for a JWT token in localStorage or sessionStorage. If a token is found, it sends it to the backend to validate the user's session and retrieve the user's information, such as the username.

Protected Routes: The application uses the stored JWT token to access protected routes in the backend. The token is sent in the x-auth-token header with each request to authenticate the user.

**3. **Navigation and Routing
React Router: The frontend uses React Router for navigation between different pages, such as the sign-in page, sign-up page, and homepage. The user's authentication state is checked before navigating to protected routes.

Dynamic Navigation: The navigation menu dynamically updates based on the user's authentication state. If the user is signed in, options like "Sign Out" are displayed, and the username is shown. If not, the "Sign In" option is available.

**4. **State Management
Global User State: The user's authentication state and information (such as username) are managed globally in the application using React's useState and useEffect hooks.

Session Persistence: The user's session persists across page reloads and browser sessions by storing the JWT token and retrieving the user's information from the backend.

**5. **Error Handling and Notifications
Error Messages: Error messages are displayed in the UI for various scenarios, such as invalid input, incorrect credentials, and server errors.

Notifications: Basic notification messages are shown for successful actions, such as successful sign-in, sign-up, or logout.

**6. Security Considerations
Secure JWT Handling: JWT tokens are securely stored and transmitted, ensuring that sensitive user data is protected.

Password Security: Passwords are never stored in plain text, and all sensitive operations (like password comparison) are handled on the backend.

**7. Future Enhancements
Forgot Password Functionality: A link for "Forgot Password" is included in the UI, which can be extended to implement a complete password reset workflow.

User Profile Management: Additional features for managing user profiles, such as updating email, password, or username, can be added.

Improved Validation: Enhanced validation for email formats, stronger password requirements, and real-time validation feedback can improve user experience.
